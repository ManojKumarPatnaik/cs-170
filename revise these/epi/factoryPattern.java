/*
The Factory Method off ers an interface for creating an instance of a class, with its subclasses deciding 
which class to instantiate. You might want to implement this with the creator class being abstract and not 
providing an implementation fo r the Factory method. Or, you could have the Creator class be a concrete 
class that provides an implementation for the Factory method. In this case, the Factory method would take 
a parameter representing which class to instantiate.
