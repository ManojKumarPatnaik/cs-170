/*
: For a certain application, processes need to locknodes in abinary tree.
Implement a library forlocking nodes in a binary tree,subjectto the constraint that a
node cannot be lockedif any of its descendants or ancestors are locked. Specifically,
write functions isLockO, lockO, and unlock 0,with time complexities0(1), O(h),
and O(h). Here h is the height of the binary tree. Assume that each node has a parent
~.
